### Self-Study Instructions

You can downlaod the course materials [here](https://github.com/coolernato/Introduction-to-LaTeX). Open the file ```Intro to Latex Slides.pptx```. When reading through the slides, refer to the notes section of the slides, which contains further explanation of the content of the slides. The notes also often contain links to Overleaf projects which contain full projects centred on the feature being demonstrated in the slides.

When the slide says "Problem Sheet" in the lower right corner, this indicates there is an exercise available in the problem sheet. Note that, to use the links in the pdf, you will need to download and open the pdf (as opposed to viewing it in the github viewer). It is recommended to complete the exercises from the problem sheet, with the exception of exercis 10, in an [Overleaf](overleaf.com) project. This will see you build a document with a variety of different features which you can than copy into other documents when you need them.
